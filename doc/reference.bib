abstract="A new approach for transient analysis of nonlinear circuits is presented. The circuit equations are formulated as functions of incident and reflected waves at the device ports. Only one large matrix decomposition is necessary if time step is constant. The proposed method is parallelizable, allows straightforward inclusion of complex nonlinear device models and has better convergence properties compared to existing methods. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the approach.",
